1. The first step to start the coding environment process is to install and configure Git.You can download Git from this website listed here: https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Download the appropriate distribution for your operating system.
Once Git is installed, open your terminal and verify that Git was installed correctly by using the command "git --version". 
3. If Git was installed correctly, it will return what version of Git was installed on your machine.

## Tutorial on starting GitHub: ##

## Tutorial on starting Webstorm: ##
1. The first step to installing Webstorm is to download the JetBrains editor through the website here: https://www.jetbrains.com/student/. Once on the website, click the option that says "Request now" to request institutional access to a JetBrains account. You will have to apply for this access with your institutional login. Once you obtain access to your JetBrains account, locate the page where it directs you to download the Webstorm editor. Download the associated Webstorm editor based on your operating system.
After Webstorm is installed and after your GitHub account is set up with your repository, alongside Git configured, open the editor and click the menu tab to open settings.
2. From the menu settings, click the “New” button and click “Project from Version Control”.
3. From your GitHub account, locate your repository you want to clone into Webstorm and click the green button that says “<> Code”. From here, you will copy the direct path for the Github repository and paste this direct path into the URL section in Webstorm.
4. Once the path from GitHub is entered, it will populate the directory with the local path on your file system and then you can click “Clone”. The repository will now be cloned.
5. From this point you should create a file in Webstorm after creating your repository by clicking “File”, then “New”, then “HTML File” to create a HTML file. Create a stylesheet file by clicking “File”, then “New”, then “Stylesheet” to create a stylesheet file.
6. When adding either an HTML or stylesheet file, a prompt will be asked to add the following files to Git which you will select “Add”. Perform changes to the files as needed.
7. When done with the coding environment, you will have to commit your changes from your local machine to upload it to the remote repository you made from before. To do so, look at the lefthand tab of Webstorm and click the option for “Commit”. From here, you will see a list of files that have been last edited when the project was opened in green.
8. These changes have not been saved yet and have to be committed, which can be done by selecting the files you wish to save changes to from your local machine to the repository and writing a commit message you would like to save. 
9. Once you selected the files you want to be committed and wrote a message, click the “Commit” button. 
10. Then click the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + K to open a menu to start the process to push changes. After reviewing all information and you are sure the changes can be pushed to a remote repository, click the “Push” button. The changes now will be visible on your GitHub repository, available for others to see and use.
